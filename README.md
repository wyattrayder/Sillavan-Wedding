# sillavan-wedding

## Project Description
```
This was a set of websites that I created for my own wedding. I created one website for our guests to use to
see all of the information regarding our wedding and also be able to RSVP!  The other website was used for
my fiancee and I to keep track of (and add) parties for our wedding.  We could see who had RSVP'd, who hadn't,
and see their song requests/notes to the bride and groom!  Just a fun little project I put together in a couple
of weeks
